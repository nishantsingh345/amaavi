            <h2> The Amaavi Philosophy </h2>
            <h4> Our story dates back to the time our world came into existence. <br> Travel back in time with us. </h4>
            <p> Centuries before the first city was built, eons before the first book was written, and millennia before humans started using ‘#wanderlust’  : our ancestors
               developed a single most pivotal trait that aided our evolution as a species. That trait was migration - simply put, the urge to travel and discover new lands.
               Scientists believe that this was a drive so important, that, if not for the yearning we developed for it, our species would have almost certainly perished.
               Travel has led to discovery, of the world around us, and of ourselves. It presents us with the unique opportunity to experience cultures, its people, their 
               ways of life, and everything that is good and bountiful on our planet - below, at, and above sea level. It takes us out of our comfort zones, and expands
               our worldview, pushing us to grow, to be open and accepting, tolerant and grateful for the gift of life.  
            </p>
            <p> Travel is immersive, in that, it changes and moulds perspectives - and when one comes out on the other side of a journey, they are changed as people,
               for the better. Ergo, travel is as external as it is internal, and the same can be said for fewer things. We are connected as a people today, only because
               someone, somewhere, way before our time, took the bold step of disregarding norms and preconceived notions and set out to discover what the world
               beyond the known world was. We have journeyed across seas, voyaged across oceans, and the thirst for exploration and discovery has now propelled us
               into the cosmos. That is the power of travel, that continually pushes the human race forward. If a timeline were to be drawn from the beginning of time
               and into the future, travel would be constant, and because of it, change. 
            </p>

            <h2> The Amaavi Philosophy </h2>
            <p> Amaavi began in August 2017 with a lofty ambition  to transform the experience of travel. For most people, travelling is a getaway. However,it is
               so much more than that. This is where Amaavi comes in with one goal. Making your travel hassle free or designing itineraries for you are the
               usual offerings. What sets us apart though, is our aim  to build a community of travellers across the world and be at the forefront for enabling
               them to have rich, multi cultural experiences that not only shape their perspectives of the world we live in but also immensely enhance the
               quality of their lives.  
            </p>
            <p>  Yes, we will customise  experiences for you. We will handle the logistics involved and also take away the pressures of all travel related hassle
               from you - such as visa applications, property reviews and selection, activities and itineraries. Whether you are looking for an elaborate, full
               fledged holiday or even a short weekend getaway, our team of experts design experiences tailored to a group or an individual’s preferences -
               while being extremely competitive with market prices.  
            </p>
            <p> Amaavi will take you on a journey of soul searching and that is not something many can stake a claim on.  </p>

                  <p class="user_content"> Ashwath Vyas S is the Founder & CEO of Amaavi Experiences Pvt Ltd. Amaavi was founded in August, 2017 with the
                     mission to make travel a hassle free and meaningful experience for people. Ashwath's tryst with travel began in 2011
                     when he was selected to intern with Grand Group Corporation, Ningbo, China. New to the country, people, food and
                     language, the experience of staying away from home for 4 months was a transformational experience for him.
                     He came back and soon started working with Worldview Education - an experiential learning company that designed
                     education travel programs for high school students. During the 4 years that he spent there, he managed partnerships
                     with universities such as Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Oxford, Yale among others and think tanks and government
                     organisations. Through these partnerships, he helped to design travel elements around history, culture, international
                     diplomacy, university immersions and personal development. Ashwath quit Worldview to work in the Real Estate
                     space with Giridhari Homes heading Marketing & Sales for one year before finally taking time off to reflect and realise
                     that his passion is to travel and meet people. As a student in CBIT, where he studied Civil Engineering, he was actively
                     part of the youth organisation - AIESEC for 3 years, where he had the chance to meet and connect with young people
                     from over 50 countries. This was the genesis of his passion.

                  <p class="user_content"> Ramya has 6 years experience in the corporate world. During her stints at Deloitte, Capgemini and Amazon she
                     gained a lot of experience in the pros and cons of processes. She had extensive experience in working with different
                     cultures and varied time zones. In her personal time she loved travelling and is an advanced open water scuba diver.
                     She has been to 10 countries till date, and still has a lot left on her bucket list. Her favourite travel experiences have
                     been to Europe, specially Austria. Although she was an avid believer of DIY travel, a mishap in Rome, a missing
                     passport and a week of wasted time pushed her to believe in the importance of a travel consultant and their role
                     in hassle free travel experiences. Her love for travel mixed with her passion for processes and research pushed her
                     to join Amaavi in April 2018 as the Chief Operating officer.
